# Genetic algorithm

Implementation of a genetic algorithm for finding the minimum of a given function *f*.

Prints out the minimal value, calculated using the given parameters:
- lower limit
- upper limit
- population size
- probability of entity mutation
- maximum count for parents remaining in the next iteration
- number of iterations of the algorithm
